This is a python curses text editor module. Due to a fair 
amount of inefficiencies this module handles large text 
documents rather badly (especially on older machines).
If you have an idea on how to further improove my code,
you can message me on social media. I will be 
greatful for any feedback. I had very little
experience coding prior to writing this project, 
so forgive me my nooddle code (pretty please :(( )

Inside of the editor you can press "ALT + m" 
to open the menu, then choose settings, you can change 
the color prefferences and choose a working directory. 
You can also edit the config file (config.txt) manually. 
It's pretty selfe-xplainatory.

///Key combinations are:///
ALT + s - write to a document
ALT + a - move cursor to the begining of the line
ALT + q - scroll to the begining of the file
ALT + w - scroll to the end of the file
ALT + o - clear the line left of the cursor
ALT + p - clear the line right of the cursor
ALT + V - paste from clipboard
    
    To move the cursor use Alt + h/j/k/l
    
    More key combinations can be added. To do so, 
    simply add a new function to the 'get_input()'
    function in custom_windows.py.

///color pairs:///
    text----bg
0 - white-black
1 - black-white
2 - black-blue
3 - yellow-black
4 - red-black
    Add more colors in 'colors()' function in 
    custom_wndows.py.
